                <p>In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started. We define elements, attributes,
                    and all the other important terms you may have heard, and where they fit into the language. We also show
                    how an HTML element is structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and explain other important
                    basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!</p>
                <p>Prerequisites: Basic computer literacy, basic software installed, and basic knowledge of working with files.
                    Objective: To gain basic familiarity with the HTML language, and get some practice writing a few HTML
                    elements.

                <header>What is HTML?</header>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your
                    browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer
                    wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different
                    parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content
                    into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on. For example, take the
                    following line of content:</p>
                <p></p>
            </section>
            <section id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element" class="main-section">
                <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
                <p>Let's explore our paragraph element a bit further:
                    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="" style="display: block; height: 200px; margin: 0px auto; width: 621px;">
                </p>
                <p>The main parts of our element are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped
                            in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take
                            effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                            slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end
                            of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead
                            to strange results
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Nesting elements</h4>
                    <br> You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that
                    our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a
                    <code>
                        &lt;strong&gt;
                    </code> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="Attributes" class="main-section">
                <header>Attributes</header>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:
                    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="&amp;lt;p class=&quot;editor-note&quot;>My cat is very grumpy&amp;lt;/p>"
                        style="display: block; height: 156px; margin: 0px auto; width: 700px;">
                </p>
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element which you don't want to appear in the actual content.
                    In this case, the class attribute allows you to give the element an identifying name that can be later
                    used to target the element with style information and other things.
                    <ol>
                        <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one
                            or more attributes.)</li>
                        <li>The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.</li>
                        <li>An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="Anatomy_of_a_HTML_document" class="main-section">
                <header>Anatomy of a HTML document</header>
                <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't very useful on their own. Now we'll
                    look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page:
                    <code>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &lt;html&gt;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &lt;head&gt;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;title&gt;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &lt;/head&gt;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                &lt;body&gt;
                            </li>
                            <li> &lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;</li>
                            <li> &lt;/body&gt;</li>
                            <li> &lt;/html&gt;</li>
                        </ol>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Here we have:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: The doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (about 1991/2),
                            doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be
                            considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things.
                            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype;
                            that's all you really need to know.</li>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>: The
                            <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes
                            known as the root element.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>: The
                            <code>
                                &lt;head&gt;
                            </code> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the
                            HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things
                            like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style
                            our content, character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in the next article
                            in the series.</li>
                        <li>
                            <code>
                                &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
                            </code>: This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8, which includes
                            most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. Essentially it can now handle
                            any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help
                            avoid some problems later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>
                                &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
                            </code>: The
                            <code>

                                &lt;title&gt;
                            </code> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser
                            tab the page is loaded in, and is used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
                        <li>
                            <code>
                                &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>: The
                            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users
                            when they visit your page, whether that 's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks,
                            or whatever else.
                        </li>

                <p>You've reached the end of the article — we hope you enjoyed your tour of the very basics of HTML! At this
                    point you should understand what the language looks like, how it works at a basic level, and be able
                    to write a few elements and attributes. This is a perfect place to be right now, as in subsequent articles
                    in the module we will go into some of the things you have already looked at in a lot more detail, and
                    introduce some new features of the language. Stay tuned!</p>
